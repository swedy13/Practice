# meteor-react-twitter-clone

[A Tutorial application at http://randomdotnext.com/](http://randomdotnext.com/meteor-tutorial-p1/) modified for using React instead of Blaze

I didn't want to fork the [tutorial's github project](https://github.com/ruler88/twitterClone) because I wanted to make the changes from blaze to react step by step as I went through the tutorial.
