# React Leaderboard

Meteor's leaderboard example app, rewritten in React.

Notes:

Make sure you update submodules after checkout to get our extended webapp + react-meteor packages, `git submodule update --remote --init`


1. Our forked version of the webapp package allows server-side rendering.

  This change is currently in consideration for Meteor core (https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/3860)

2. Our fork of https://github.com/reactjs/react-meteor works with Meteor 1.0.3.2.
